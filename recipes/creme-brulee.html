        Creme Brulee, a very delicious treat well worth the time it takes to make. Yield: Makes 6 creme brulees.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar, plus extra sugar for caramelizing</li>
        <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
    
    <p>
        Pre-heat oven to 300Â°F.
        Separate the eggs. Use the yolks for making creme brulee. 
        Beat the eggs with a whisk for a minute or two, until they're very smooth.
        Add the sugar and whisk for about 2 more minutes, or until the the sugar is fully incorporated and the yolks are a pale shade of yellow. Now add the vanilla and whisk until blended.
        Add the cream and whisk until blended.    
        pour the egg and cream mixture through a wire strainer into another bowl. Straining the custard filters out any eggy bits to ensure a nice, smooth consistency.

        Fill a large roasting pan with an inch or two of warm water, and place your empty ramekins into the pan. The water should come about halfway up the ramekins. Carefully pour the custard into the ramekins.
        Transfer the roasting pan into the oven and bake for 35 minutes or until the edges of the creme brulees are set but the centers just barely jiggle when you nudge the pan.
        Remove the pan from the oven and let the creme brulees cool and then place in the refrigerator.
    </p>
    <p>
        About 20 minutes before you're ready to caramelize the tops, remove the creme brulees from the refrigerator.
        Sprinkle the tops of the creme brulees with granulated white sugar. Make sure you cover the whole surface, and swirl the ramekins to distribute the sugar evenly. Shake off any excess sugar.
        Ignite your torch and carefully apply the flame to the sugar, keeping it constantly in motion. The sugar will start to liquefy, and then turn caramel-colored. When a nice, hard glaze forms, you're done.
        Pop the creme brulees back into the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so before serving them, just to re-chill the creme brulees after they've been heated by the torch.
        You can serve the creme brulees just as they are, and they'll be absolutely delicious. Put a few fresh berries and a dusting of powdered sugar is a nice, elegant touch.
